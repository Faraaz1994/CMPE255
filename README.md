# CMPE255
Facial Emotion Recognition

This is a [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data). The dataset consists of 48x48 grayscale images of faces. All the faces are centrally aligned and occupy around the same amount of space. The objective of this project is to recognise the emotion depicted by the human in the image.

As of now we have built multiple models using Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Recurrent Neural Networks. We plan to use decision tree and K-Nearest Neighbours in future. The notebooks are present in the src folder.
